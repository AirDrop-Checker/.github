### üí° **What is AirDrop Checker?**  
AirDrop Checker is a **next-gen, open-source platform** built for crypto enthusiasts, DeFi participants, blockchain developers, and project teams to **streamline airdrop discovery, validate legitimacy, and maximize rewards** in the decentralized ecosystem. Unlike basic airdrop trackers, this tool combines **real-time data aggregation**, **smart contract analysis**, and **security audits** to empower users with actionable insights while safeguarding against scams.  

Whether you‚Äôre a hodler hunting high-value airdrops, a developer integrating airdrop analytics into your dApp, or a project team auditing token distribution fairness, AirDrop Checker is your all-in-one solution for navigating the chaotic world of crypto rewards.

### üöÄ **Core Features**  
#### **1. Airdrop Discovery & Tracking**  
‚úÖ **Multi-Chain Monitoring**: Track airdrops across **Ethereum, Solana, BNB Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism**, and more.  
‚úÖ **Real-Time Alerts**: Get notified via Discord, Telegram, or email about new airdrops, eligibility windows, and claim deadlines.  
‚úÖ **Filter & Sort**: Customize searches by chain, token type (ERC-20, SPL, etc.), reward size, or KYC requirements.  

#### **2. Eligibility & Compliance Checks**  
‚úÖ **Wallet Activity Analysis**: Automatically scan transaction history, token balances, and protocol interactions to confirm eligibility (e.g., "Did I interact with Uniswap v3 in time for the UNI airdrop?").  
‚úÖ **Snapshot Verification**: Cross-reference blockchain snapshots to validate if your wallet qualifies for retroactive rewards.  
‚úÖ **KYC/AML Pre-Screening**: Check if your wallet complies with airdrop-specific requirements (e.g., non-sanctioned regions).  

#### **3. Security & Scam Prevention**  
‚úÖ **Contract Audits**: Automatically scan token contracts for red flags like honeypots, malicious mint functions, or hidden fees.  
‚úÖ **Phishing Detection**: Verify links and platform URLs against a community-driven blacklist of scams.  
‚úÖ **Approval Risk Analysis**: Highlight risky token approvals that could drain your wallet.  

#### **4. Developer & Project Tools**  
‚úÖ **REST API**: Integrate airdrop data into wallets, dashboards, or analytics platforms (e.g., fetch eligibility status for 10,000 wallets in seconds).  
‚úÖ **Fair Distribution Audits**: For projects, analyze airdrop recipient lists for Sybil attacks, bot activity, or geographic bias.  
‚úÖ **Custom Scripts**: Write plugins to automate tasks like bulk-claiming tokens or generating eligibility reports.

### üõ†Ô∏è **Technical Details**  
- **Languages**: Python (CLI), TypeScript (API/web dashboard), Solidity/Rust (smart contract analysis).  
- **APIs**: Alchemy, Etherscan, Solana RPC, Coingecko, and proprietary threat intelligence feeds.  
- **Security**: Zero private key storage, local data processing, and end-to-end encryption for API requests.  

---

### üåê **Supported Blockchains**  
- **EVM Chains**: Ethereum, Polygon, BNB Chain, Avalanche, Arbitrum, Optimism, Fantom.  
- **Non-EVM Chains**: Solana, Algorand, Cosmos, Near, Polkadot.  
- **Layer-2 & Rollups**: zkSync, StarkNet, Immutable X.

### üìö **Use Cases**  
- **DeFi Users**: Track airdrops from protocols like Uniswap, Aave, or Curve.  
- **NFT Collectors**: Discover retroactive rewards from NFT platforms (e.g., OpenSea, Magic Eden).  
- **DAO Participants**: Verify voting power from governance token airdrops.  
- **Projects**: Audit airdrop fairness and prevent Sybil attacks.

### üåü **Why AirDrop Checker Stands Out?**  
1. **Proactive Scam Protection**: Unlike passive trackers, we actively block malicious contracts.  
2. **Cross-Chain Dominance**: Covering 95% of airdrop activity across 15+ chains.  
3. **Privacy-First Design**: No wallet data is stored or shared‚Äîever.  
4. **Community-Driven**: Crowdsourced airdrop calendar updates and scam reports.

### üö® **Security Warnings**  
- **Never share your seed phrase**‚ÄîAirDrop Checker requires only public wallet addresses.  
- **Verify contracts manually** even if our tool flags them as "safe."  

---

### ü§ù **Join the Ecosystem**  
- **Contribute**: Add new chain integrations, improve detection algorithms, or translate the UI.  
- **Report Scams**: Submit phishing links or malicious contracts to our community database.  
- **Request Features**: Need a specific chain or tool? Open an issue!
